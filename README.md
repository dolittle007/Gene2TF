# TF-STAR

TF-STAR: a versatile tool for identifying key transcription factors for human diseases through analysis of the regulatory regions of disease genes or associated variants 



## Introduction



## Prerequisites

The software is developed and tested in Linux and Max OS environments.

You need  [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/), and some python packages 

* [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [concurrent.futures](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/futures)
* [tqdm](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tqdm)
* [argparse](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/argparse)

to run TF-STAR.

## Project Layout


## Input data
TF-STAR will calculate the TF enrichment results from input genes.
Some support data is needed, that needs to be set up prior TF-STAR execution.

The gist of TF-STAR input is:
- database (an example is 
- A file with the covar
-  results (such aswhich are just randomly generated)
